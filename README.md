We solve for the bound states of a 2D potential by diganolizing the Hamiltonian. The basis functions are now
the product functions of two harmonic oscillator wavefunctions. 

Module: harmf.py contains the details of the basis
Module: pot2D.py contains the potential functions which can be modified by the user
