We solve for the bound states of a 2D potential by diganolizing the Hamiltonian. The basis functions are now
the product functions of two independent harmonic oscillator wavefunctions (for x- and y- variables). Computatio is similar to what we did in the 1D case.

Module: harmf.py contains the details of the basis
Module: pot2D.py contains the potential functions which can be modified by the user
